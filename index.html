  <div>
  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>The Archery Club is a sport club for Ohio State University students, faculty and alumni
    with an interest in the sport of archery. Many of our members joined as first-time shooters who
    have grown into skilled archers with the help of our nationally ranked coaches and their unwavering commitment and support.</p>

  <p>We believe in encouraging and supporting anyone who wants to learn to shoot by providing equipment
     and various practice opportunities to enhance the learning experience. With a very diverse group of students and varying skill
     levels, the Archery Clubâ€™s mission is to promote camaraderie among archers, not only on the range,
     but in various club activities, and in doing so, growing roots that extend beyond the borders of Ohio State.</p>

        technique so that you are one step closer to a perfect shot.
